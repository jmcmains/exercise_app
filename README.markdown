Ideas for the future:

Interface sort of like a music player, (songs = single exercises, playlist = workouts)
Users can add exercises in a set format (explanation, steps, tips) (we would also use this to streamline data entry

Users can share their exercises and workouts to their friends in the app or on their stream

Space for ads (monetized this way)

This could be a platform for fitness experts and trainers to give their students workouts (possible public/private sharing, could trainers sell workouts, and obviously we would take a small percentage)

Section for badges (keeps people coming back to the app to say that they did the exercise)

Badges for repeat exercises, number of exercises, creating exercises (possibly creator of exercise can create a badge for it)
Top ten reps/time in the exercise page
