Legs|Quadriceps (Quads), Hamstrings (Hams), Calves, Buttock (Glutes), and Hips|Always protect your knees! Don’t lock them out during any exercise to avoid excess strain. Start with a low resistance to enhance your form and encourage proper muscle development. Keep the bands taut by staying within the constant line of resistance so that your leg muscles never get a rest until after your set. Perform each exercise slowly to prevent momentum from speeding up your repetitions. Stay conscious of your breathing patterns to help maintain a consistent tempo, especially for more challenging lifts; exhale during the difficult portion and then inhale while returning back up to starting position. Last but not least... keep those abs tight and that back straight!|
Biceps|Biceps Brachii (Biceps): and Forearms|Fully extend and contract your arms to get the entire range of motion for each biceps exercise. Remember to maintain constant tension on bands by not lowering you arms below the minimum point of resistance; this prevents your biceps from resting during the set. Keep your wrists straight and your elbows in a fixed position to help channel the resistance to your biceps. Try adjusting the A.P. height or your distance from the post to alter the resistance. As with most exercises, keep your abs tight and back straight for core stability.|
Back|Litissimus Dorsi (Lats) and Rhomboides|"Protect your lower back by keeping your abs tight and your back straight. Squeeze your shoulder blades together behind you to engage lat muscles.
Hold the contraction momentarily at the point of maximum resistance before returning to starting position. Inserting a bar will lower the resistance and help balance the weight distribution. This shouldn’t be back-breaking work, so start with low resistance to ensure proper form!"|
Stretching||Stretching opens up passageways in your body so that blood can better circulate and carry oxygen to muscles, speeding up the recovery process and enhancing your joint flexibility and optimal muscle lengths. We have taken the liberty of renaming, and in some cases naming, the following stretches to make them easier for you to remember.|
Chest|Pectoralis (Pecs)|Chest workouts concentrate on three areas: the upper, middle, and bottom. Keep your back straight, abs tight, and focus on utilizing your chest muscles for the following exercises. You will naturally work out your triceps when working out your chest. If you do not feel the resistance in the targeted area, try readjusting the anchor point (A.P.) height and/or your proximity to it. Remember to hold your rep at the point of maximum resistance for a few moments before returning back to starting position for a challenge (Static Contraction Training). Have a blast!|
Core|Abdominals (Abs), Obliques, Lower Back|A strong core ensures the physique you want and protects your lower back, but also makes your whole body feel stronger, more limber and better balanced. Strengthening your core is important since every body movement should stem from this region. High intensity and attention to detail are the keys to a sound core workout. Dig down to the core of your being and go hard while keeping great form!|
Triceps|Triceps Brachii|Tricep muscles are composed of three heads: lateral head, long head, and medial head – hence the TRI in triceps. Target your triceps more acutely by keeping your wrists straight and elbows planted in a fixed position with your upper arms still. Maintain constant tension on bands by not regressing past the minimum point of resistance so your muscles don’t get a break until after the set. During your set, take your time and flex your triceps for a few moments at the point of maximum resistance before returning back to starting position. If you don’t feel the resistance in your triceps, try readjusting the A.P. and/or your distance from the post. Finally, keep your abs tight and back straight to protect and stabilize your core. TRI it, baby!|
Shoulders|Deltoids (Delts) and Trapezius (Traps)|Deltoids consist of three main areas: front (anterior), lateral (medial) and rear (posterior). Start with a low resistance to enhance your form and avoid injury. Inserting a bar will help to balance the resistance and offer more control. Maintain at least minimal resistance on the bands at all times for a more efficient workout and to minimize the shock to your muscles when beginning the subsequent rep. Hold your rep briefly at the point of maximum resistance for a challenge (Static Contraction Training). If you don’t feel the resistance in your targeted muscle group, readjust the A.P. and/or your distance from the post. As with most exercises, keep your abs tight and back straight to protect and stabilize your core. You will feel great after your workout if you can shoulder the load.|
