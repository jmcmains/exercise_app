Anchor point (AP)|The exact location where you wrap, stabilize, fasten, or loop a band to a fixed object. Adjusting the anchor point will normally result in a change of resistance: the further you are from the A.P., the higher the resistance, while the closer you are to the A.P., the lower the resistance.|
Bar/stick|This can be anything that is straight and narrow enough to wrap your hands around. The material doesn´t matter as long as the weight of the item does not impede your ability to easily lift it. Examples may include, but are not limited to: broom or mop stick, tree branch, metal shaft, or a pole.|
Compound exercise|An exercise that requires more than one joint movement at a time to perform the lift. These exercises work various muscle groups at the same time and should be done often for strength development. In contrast, lifts that concentrate on one muscle group at a time are known as isolation exercises. Examples of compound exercises include:  BENCH PRESS, PUSH-UPS, PULLDOWNS, ROWS, DIPS, MILITARY PRESS, SQUATS, LUNGES, and DEADLIFTS.|
Drop set|A double set where you complete a full set, and then immediately lower the resistance to do a second “drop set” of the same lift to further exhaust your muscles.|
Ends|The part of the band that is convenient to grasp or insert an attachment to when the band is doubled over (we do recognize that circular bands have no true ends).|
Fasten|To secure one end of a band in place by circling the band around an object and then pulling one end through the other.|x
Front post|A post located in front of you when performing a lift.|
Grasp|A generic term meaning to, ¨hold the bar, handgrip, or band ends in your hand.|
Handgrips|Cushioned attachments for the bands available for a more comfortable grip.|
High-intensity training|An exercise philosophy we advocate that suggests exerting yourself by performing as many repetitions as you can until you reach failure in each set.|
Holds|The option of wide, narrow, overhand, or underhand grips you can choose to use for any given exercise.|
Lift|"The specific exercise you perform. Examples of lifts are FLAT BENCH PRESS, SQUAT, MILITARY PRESS. This term is used interchangeable with ""exercise"""|
Loop|To circle the band around an object for the purpose of raising the resistance by shortening the band’s exposed length.|x
Muscle confusion|Continuously modifying your routines to prevent muscles plateaus (making minimal gains). Altering your routines periodically is very important. In addition to selecting different exercises, you can also modify the resistance and perform more or less reps accordingly. Integrating negatives, static contraction training, drop sets, and supersets are great ways to vary your workout.|
Muscle fatigue (also: failure, exhaustion)|The point in the set where you can’t lift an additional repetition without cheating. Upon reaching your point of exhaustion, you can always try and muster out partial reps, which are less than full range-of-motion repetitions.|
Narrow grip|Spacing your hands close together when performing an exercise.|x
Negatives|A controlled muscle resistance that involves fighting the regression portion of the exercise. In contrast to conventional repetitions, which normally begin at the easiest point before peaking (concentric movement) and then returning back to the easiest point (eccentric movement), negatives begin at the peak of the repetition (after the concentric movement) and slowly resist the retreat back to starting position (isometric movement). It has been suggested that this portion of the exercise stimulates the most muscle and is therefore responsible for the greatest growth.|
Overhand grip|Grasping the BAR/STICK, handgrips, or band with your palms facing down.|x
Overhead post|A post located anywhere above your head when performing a lift.|
Post|This is a very broad term that encompasses anything you could attach a band to for the purpose of creating resistance on the opposite end. Examples may include, but are not limited to: your feet, back, a tree, bedpost, pillar, support beam, or your door strap. How and where you attach a band to a post is what determines your anchor point.|
Rear post|A post located behind you when performing a lift.|
Repetitions (reps)|The completion of one full motion called for by a particular exercise.|
Routine|The group of exercises you perform in one workout.|
Set|The amount of reps you do at one given time before resting.|
Side/lateral post|A post located at your side.|
Stabilize|To secure one end of a band in place by inserting an object through to limit that side’s mobility.|x
Staggered sets|Sets of a non-related exercise or activity infused into your workoutroutine. Staggered sets can be anything you want to include in your workout such as: push-ups, pull-ups, stretching, yoga, core exercises, or homework. An additional bonus of working out with exercise bands is that you can spread out your workout over the course of a few hours if necessary. Short doses of exercise can be rewarding anytime, even if done intermittently between chapters, commercials, meetings, or traffic lights. Stagger exercise into life! Please note that ACSM advocates working out for at least 25 minutes for a true benefit.|
Static isometric contraction training|Instead of performing a complete repetition, hold your rep at the point of maximum resistance until your muscles fatigue. These extended reps can be performed once or multiple times to make up a set. The difference between this and negatives, is that with static contraction you are holding the resistance in one place, where as with negatives you are slowly retreating back to starting position.|
Superset|Doing two different lifts for two different muscle groups back-to-back. For example, doing one set of a chest lift, and then immediately doing a set of bicep exercises before resting. While you are working out one muscle, the other muscle has time to rest and recover. This will keep up your workout intensity, speed up your workout, and leave your muscles exhausted afterwards. This is great for the split routines and circuit training routines.|
Underhand grip|Grasping the BAR/STICK, handgrips, or band with your palms facing up.|x
Wide grip|Spacing your hands far apart when performing an exercise.|x
Wrap|To secure the middle of a band in place by doubling it around an object. Try to position the ends of the band as close together as possible to prevent them from slipping.|x
