Bamboo Barbell|"This can be anything that is straight and narrow enough to wrap your hands
around. The material doesn't matter as long as the weight of the item does not impede your ability to easily lift it. Examples may include, but are not limited to: broom or mop stick, tree branch, metal shaft, or a pole. We recommend the Bamboo Barbell from our store."|accessory/barbell.jpg|http://rubberbanditz.com/accessories/bamboo-barbells/
Soft Hand Grip|Cushioned attachments for the bands available for a more comfortable grip. Compared to traditional tube bands that have the handles attached to each end, you will never have to worry about our handles popping off or being limited by the amount of exercises you can perform.|accessory/handgrip.jpg|http://rubberbanditz.com/accessories/soft-hand-grips/
Padded Ankle Grip|Padded devices that make leg exercises easy and enjoyable. Adjustable straps ensure that one size fits all. Forget about those uncomfortable pads digging into your shins; these soft grips attach to the circular bands via a stainless steel carabiner for security and durability. An exterior embedded D-ring provides strength and stability. The ankle grips are essential for doing your leg curls, leg extensions and abductors/adductors. Strap them onto your wrists for a series of upper body exercises, too.|accessory/anklegrip.jpg|http://rubberbanditz.com/accessories/padded-ankle-grips/
Door Strap|Simple, yet brilliant apparatus enables you to perform almost every exercise imaginable using almost any door. Turn your door into a gym by inserting this strap between the door and the frame. Adjust the height of the strap anywhere from the base to the top of the door for a full range of anchor point options. Use two door straps and insert one on either side of the door to create dual anchor points. Door straps add meaning to a-door-able.|accessory/doorstrap.jpg|http://rubberbanditz.com/accessories/door-strap/
Hand Strap|Provides a comfy grip to hold, and prevents any irritation between your hand and the band. The Velcro ends make it easy to attach or remove. To prevent irriation, use the straps anywhere the band makes contact with your body. Works well not only for your hands, but also around your ankles, shoulders and behind your neck. Or, use these like a zip-tie and combine multiple bands by bunching them together tightly to increase resistance.|accessory/handstrap.jpg|http://rubberbanditz.com/accessories/hand-strap/
Rubberlution T-Shirt|A few months ago, we at Rubberbanditz decided that we wanted to branch out from selling our top-notch Pullup, Therapy, Powerlifting, and Exercise bands. So we asked our Facebook fans what they would want to see on a Rubberbanditz T-Shirt. They voted overwhelmingly for the “Join The Resistance” slogan. So to salute our fans, we bring to you the official Rubberbanditz – Join The Resistance T-shirt. Its been printed on a Port & Company -  Essential T-Shirt which according to Port is “A year-round essential, our best-selling t-shirt has been voted “most popular” by groups, teams, clubs and schools across America.”|accessory/tshirt.jpg|http://rubberbanditz.com/accessories/club-rubberlution-t-shirt/
